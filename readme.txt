A Bootstrap 4 powered theme with a contrasting color scheme. It has an emphasis on clear typography with enough space for your content to breath.

== Description ==
All the Bootstrap Styles and Scripts are ready to use in your posts or for any custom features (a slim mode is available for performance - containing only the styles and scripts needed by the theme).

Comes with 3 Layout Templates (left sidebar, right sidebar, no sidebar) and a bundled custom front-page template - with a slider, posts list and 2 widget areas. There are several different widget and sidebar locations (including post start and post end) to make it flexible enough to have the content you want in the location you choose.

Theme is built to be SEO friendly, utilizing proper title tags and other markup where appropriate.

It also includes some basic support for styling Gravity Forms to keep it in line with Bootstrap form styles.

== Limitations ==
This theme uses `Bootstrap` and the `WP Bootstrap Navwalker` so navigation is limited to only a top level and a single level of dropdown. Additionally items with dropdowns have the links converted to '#' - this is in line with Bootstrap standards and is due to clickable dropdown toggles not being touch screen friendly.
